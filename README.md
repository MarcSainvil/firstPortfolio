## Setup

In this workshop, you'll be adding functionality to a pre-written (but incomplete) application.

Make sure to `yarn install` the dependencies from the root folder. From there, you can `yarn start` to see the initial application.

If you want to load React on the specified PORT of 3005, you can use `yarn start-mac` or `yarn start-windows` depending on the OS you're on.

The playful application offers a few children's stories: "Tiny Time Tales". `App.js` establishes several `<Route>`s:

| URL             | Component         | Contents                                                  |
| --------------- | ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| "/"             | `<Introduction/>` | Welcome to Tiny Time Tales, and Links to /books and /time |
| "/books"        | `<Books/>`        | Links to each book                                        |
| "/book/:bookId" | `<Book/>`         | A single book                                             |
| "/time"         | `<WhatTimeIsIt/>` | An incomplete analog clock                                |
| "/*"            | `<Navigate/>`     | No content - force navigates the url back to "/"          |

Each Route's component will be found in its own folder in `/src/pages`. Note that each of those folders may contain more components, and that the namesake component from each folder can be found in `index.js`.
